This example makes use of the NXP PN532 card-reader. This example was developed and tested using
the PN532 NFC RFID Module V3. Documentation on the card-reader itself can be found
on the [NXP website](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/141520.pdf).

The client code for dealing with the card-reader is based on an Arduino PN532 library, it can
