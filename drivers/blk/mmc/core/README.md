## Adding Support for a New Hardware Platform

Porting the driver to a new hardware platform involves implementing the hardware-specific logic. Follow these steps:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself:** Study the driver's architecture and review the reference implementation for the Odroid C4 to understand the core components.
2.  **Implement the HAL:** Create a new hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for your platform by implementing the `SdmmcHardware` trait. This trait defines the interface for all hardware-specific operations.
3.  **Build with Logging:** Compile your HAL and the core protocol crate with the `dev-logs` feature enabled to get detailed diagnostic output.
4.  **Test and Verify:** Run the driver on your hardware. Analyze the logs to verify that the initialization sequence and command responses are correct.
