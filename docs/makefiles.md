The GNUmake build system
================================

The build system is structured so that each board, toolchain, driver
and component has a 'snippet' -- a fragment of a Makefile -- that can
be included in a project Makefile.

In the examples directories you will see how they are used.

There is a Makefile, that sets up a directory for the example to be
built in.  It copies a per-example Makefile into the build directory,
then invokes Make recursively inside the build directory.

The per-example Makefile sets up some variables, then includes
`tools/Make/board/common.mk` which in turn includes board and
tool-chain specific snippets.  These set up variables for controlling
the build --- see the list of variables below.  In particular, the
names of directories holding the drivers for the board are put into
specific variables.  The project directory then can `include` the
drivers it needs, using these variables.

Variables
---------

### Set by top-level Makefile, command line, or environment ###

| Variable           | Purpose                                |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------|
| `BUILD`            | Name of Build directory                |
| `TOOLCHAIN`        | Either `clang` or `gcc`                |
| `MICROKIT_BOARD`   | Board to build for                     |
| `MICROKIT_SDK`     | Directory containing the SDK           |
| `SUPPORTED_BOARDS` | List of boards that are known to work  |
| `MICROKIT_CONFIG`  | `benchmark`, `debug`, or `release`     |
| `SDDF`             | Name of top level directory containing |
|                    | the SDDF source tree                   |


### Set by Board snippet ###
All the `...DRIV_DIR` variables give the name relative to
`${SDDF}/drivers/`_deviceclass_

| Variable         | Purpose                                            |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| `PLATFORM`       | Internal use: the name of the 'platform'           |
| `CPU`            | For aarch64 only: the CPU variant to optimise for  |
| `BLK_DRIV_DIR`   | Directory containing the block driver              |
| `I2C_DRIV_DIR`   | Directory containing the I2C host driver           |
| `NET_DRIV_DIR`   | First ethernet driver                              |
| `ETH_DRIV_DIR1`  | Second ethernet driver                             |
| `ETH_DRIV`       | Name of elf file for first ethernet driver         |
| `ETH_DRIV1`      | Name of elf file for second ethernet driver        |
| `TIMER_DRIV_DIR` | Directory containing timer driver                  |
| `UART_DRIV_DIR`  | Directory containing the asynchronous serial driver |


### Set by `common.mk` ###

| Variable        | Purpose                                     |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| `BOARD_DIR`     | Directory inside the Microkit SDK for       |
|                 | the board and `MICROKIT_CONFIG`             |
| `MICROKIT_TOOL` | Tool from the Microkit                      |
| `DTS`           | Device tree source for the board            |
| `DTB`           | Device tree binary name                     |
| `DTC`           | Device tree compiler                        |
| `PYTHON`        | Name of python interpreter to use           |
| `LDFLAGS`       | A start at the board-specific flags to `ld` |





`common.mk` also generates a file that is named by the hash of
toolchain, board, and `MICROKIT_SDK`, and adds its name to the
`.EXTRA_PREREQS` variable.  This means that if any of these things
change, everything will be rebuilt.

### Set by the Toolchain make snippet ###

The Toolchain make snippet (for cang or gcc) sets the usual compiler
names (`CC`, `LD`, `RANLIB` etc.

In addition it sets `ARCH` to either `riscv64` or `aarch64`; and sets
up the CFLAGS to build and optimise for the board's CPU.

CFLAGS includes an OPTIMISATION variable; this is set by default to `-O3
-g`, but can be overridden on the Make command line.

### Driver Make Snippets ###

Each driver make snippet (except for Ethernet) generates an ELF file called
_class_`driver.elf`.  To build the elf file, include the snippet in
your Makefile and then make sure your final target depends on the ELF
file.

Ethernet is special.  Some boards have more than one ethernet device
that need different drivers.  If your project needs only one ethernet
device, you can depend on `eth_driver.elf`; it will be built from
whatever is the first ethernet device defined in the board file.

If you need more than one ethernet device, you will need to use the
_real_ name of the ethernet drivers you need.  So for the imx8mp series
of boards, the first ethernet device uses `eth_driver_imx.elf` and the
second (if needed) uses `eth_driver_dwmac-5.10a.elf`; these are the
ones you need to deal with in your Makefile.
