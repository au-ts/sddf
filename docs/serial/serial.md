# sDDF Serial Subsystem

## System architecture

The serial subsystem adheres to the sDDF design principles of modularalised components split via
separation of concerns. Components communicate via shared queues and data regions, as well as
asynchronous notifications (Microkit channels). For a more in depth discussion of these design
principles and how the serial subsystem incorporates them, see the [sDDF design
document](/docs/design_doc).

The UART driver protection domain handles all UART device interrupts, and is the only protection
domain with access to the UART registers. In order to safely share the UART device, the UART driver
interfaces with a pair of serial virtualisers which in turn multiplex client input and output. The
serial transmit virtualiser is responsible for multiplexing client output, while the serial receive
virtualiser is responsible for deciding which characters are directed to which client.

### Serial Queues

To pass characters between components two shared memory regions are used - a *data region* where
characters are written to and read from, and a *queue* region which imposes a ring buffer structure
on the data region. The queue keeps track of the *head* and *tail* indices, the head being the next
index of the data region to be read from, and the tail being the next index of the data region to be
written to. Head and tail indices are kept as overflowing unsigned integers, and must be used modulo
*queue capacity* when accessing queues. This enforces the constraint that queue capacity must be a
power of two.

All sDDF queues are single producer single consumer, and as a consequence the head index is only
written to by the consumer of the queue, and the tail index is only written to by the producer of
the queue. This allows the queues to be accessed without a lock, with the only concurrency concern
being the consistency of the order of queue operations which is maintained using memory barriers.

The *serial_queue* data structure contains the queue head, tail and *producer_signalled*
notification flag [described below](#signalling), while *serial_queue_handle* data structure
contains a pointer to the serial queue, the queue capacity and a pointer to the data region. The
serial queue and data regions reside in separate shared memory regions, while the queue handle
resides in local memory ensuring that queue capacity may not be modified by untrusted clients which
could result in out of bound data region accesses. Serial queue library functions are written to
take serial queue handles as arguments, so it is recommended to use serial queue handles over raw
serial queues.

The implementation of the serial queue and serial queue handle along with the serial queue library
functions can be found in the [serial queue library](/include/sddf/serial/queue.h).

### Serial Communication Protocols {#signalling}

When a producer has enqueued characters in a queue, or a consumer has dequeued characters from a
queue, we say that *work* has been performed on the queue. In order for further work to be
performed, it is typically the case that the working component will need to signal its neighbour in
order for it to be scheduled.

In the case of work being performed by the producer, the consumer of the queue will unconditionally
be signalled. In contrast, if work is performed by the consumer of a queue, this is only relevant to
the producer of the queue if it is awaiting free space to enqueue additional characters. To minimise
unnecessary signals from the consumer to the producer, the serial subsystem utilises a *notification
flag* for the producer to indicate to the consumer that it requires a signal if more space has
become available. If upon finishing dequeueing characters the consumer finds the
*producer_signalled* flag set to false, it will set the flag to true and signal its neighbour.

This procedure of signalling based on the value of a *notification flag* is an instance of the *sDDF
signalling protocol*, and is written in such a way to prevent deadlocks from race conditions.
Further information on the specifics of this protocol can also be found in the [sDDF design
document](/docs/design_doc). Failure to follow this protocol when interfacing with sDDF components
may result in data processing delays, or in the worst case deadlocks.

## Transmission

For a client to transmit characters, it must first write these characters to the data region it
shares with the transmit virtualiser, then update the tail of the queue making the addition of these
characters visible to the transmit virtualiser. Finally, it must signal the virtualiser to ensure it
is scheduled to pass the characters to the driver.

Since the serial subsystem typically handles the output of more than one client at a time, a method
has been developed to enable a degree multiplexing output between clients. To support transmission
without interference, clients can optionally enqueue entire strings at a time in their data regions,
only updating the shared tail of the queue and signalling when either a *flush* character is scene
(by default a '\n'), or when the data region is full. This means that when the transmit virtualiser
copies the data from a client's buffer into the driver's buffer, it will not be interrupted by the
output of other clients, vastly improving the readability of the system's output.

Unfortunately this method is not foolproof however, as Microkit debug output will always take
precedence over the UART driver possibly interrupting client strings. Also, this multiplexing method
will only work successfully if *all* clients batch their output in this way.

Depending on how you would like your client's output to be handled, there are three general methods
you can choose from to interface your client with the transmit virtualiser:

1. Use the serial queue library functions. `serial_enqueue` enqueues a single character into a queue
   and updates the shared tail immediately, making the character available to be transmitted out the
   UART. `serial_enqueue_local` writes a character to the data region, but updates a local version
   of the tail rather than the shared tail, allowing a client to batch enqueue characters without
   making them visible. When a batch of characters is ready to be transmitted
   `serial_update_shared_tail` can be used to make the batch visible. `serial_enqueue_batch` can
   also be used to enqueue a buffer of characters into the queue, which updates the shared tail upon
   completion.

   All of these methods still require a signal to the virtualiser afterwards to ensure it is
   scheduled to process the queue.

2. Link the client elf file with the [sDDF utility library](/util/) (libsddf_util.a). This gives
   clients access to `sddf_printf` and `sddf_dprintf` (which only outputs in debug configurations)
   which are linked with `sddf_putchar`. `sddf_putchar` calls `serial_enqueue_local` on characters
   of strings outputted using `sddf_[d]printf`, only updating the shared tail when the flush
   character is seen, or the data region is full. The transmit virtualiser will also be signalled
   upon updating the shared tail.

   In order to use this method, the `sddf_putchar` library will need to be initialised before
   calling `sddf_[d]printf` so that the transmit queue handle and serial transmit virtualiser
   Microkit channel are known to the library.

   If a protection domain only needs to be able to print in debug configurations, it can instead be
   linked with `libsddf_util_debug.a`, which does not require it to be a client of the serial
   subsystem, nor does it require initialisation. In this case, sddf_[d]printf will be linked with
   the debug version of `sddf_putchar` which will similarly batch output until a flush character or
   character limit is seen before calling `microkit_dbg_puts`.

3. Write your own custom interface functions. The client may write to the data region itself without
   using any of the `serial_enqueue*` functions. Care must be taken to ensure that the queue is not
   written past its capacity (which would overwrite valid data), and that the tail is updated using
   the correct memory barriers (it is still recommended to use `serial_update_shared_tail` to update
   the tail which will check for overwriting existing data and handle memory safety). [LionOS NFS
   component](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/blob/main/components/fs/nfs/posix.c) shows one
   example of a custom output function. Similarly [LionsOS Micropython
   component](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/blob/main/components/micropython/mphalport.c)
   demonstrates an example of a *lossless* output function, where in the case of the transmit data
   region being full Micropython requests a signal from the transmit virtualiser and waits until
   there is space in the data region before continuing transmission.

For each of these methods, special care must be taken to consider the following cases:

### Carriage Returns

Whether a `\r` should be added automatically to client output preceding a `\n`. `sddf_putchar` does
this automatically when using `sddf_[d]printf`.

### Reaching Data Region Capacity

How to handle the data region hitting capacity. The `serial_enqueue*` functions will return with an
error if called when the queue is full. When the queue reaches capacity, it is recommended that the
serial virtualiser is signalled immediately to prevent data loss, as is done in `sddf_putchar`.
However, if the client attempts to output more data before the virtualiser is able to clear from the
data region, this data will be lost. In order to gracefully handle this case, it is best for the
client to set the `producer_signalled` flag to false which will result in the transmit virtualiser
signalling the client when there is free space available in the queue. This will require the client
to keep track of output awaiting space in the transmit data region. A simpler way to avoid this
problem is to set the capacity of a client's data region large enough to buffer all possible bursts
of output.

## Reception

In contrast to transmission which is client driven, receiving a character is device driven, and the
decision as to which client receives which character is driven by the stream of characters
themselves. When a character is received, the interrupt is handled by the UART driver which copies
all available characters to the receive virtualiser's data region, conditional on the region having
available space. The tail of the shared queue is then updated accordingly, and the receive
virtualiser is signalled.

Characters are categorised by the receive virtualiser as either *special* or *ordinary*. All
ordinary characters are written directly to the data region of the *current client*, which by
default is client 0 but can be re-configured at run time using special characters. Special
characters are not passed to the current client, and instead are used to change the *state* of the
receive virtualiser allowing the current client to be updated.

The receive virtualiser has three states:
1. *normal* - Any received character that is not the *switch character* will be passed directly to
   the current client. Once the receive virtualiser finishes processing all characters in the driver
   data region, the shared tail will be update and the current client will be signalled. If the
   switch character is received, the virtualiser will change state to the *switched* state.

2. *switched* - In the switched state, the virtualiser expects to receive a decimal number
   corresponding to the next desired current client. Entering the switch character again *escapes*
   the character, resulting in the switch character being passed to the current client, and the
   state returning to normal. If a digit character is received, it will be interpreted as the first
   digit of the next current client, and will change the virtualiser state to *number*. If any other
   character is entered, it will be treated as erroneous input. The character will not be passed to
   the current client, and the state will return to normal with no change in current client.

3. *number* - The number state allows the user to enter up to `MAX_CLI_BASE_10 - 1` more numbers
   making up the decimal representation of the next current client. No characters entered in this
   state will ever be transferred to clients. If more than the maximum digits are entered, or a non
   digit character is received, this will be treated as erroneous input and will return the state to
   normal with no change to current client. Once the desired client number is entered, the
   *terminate number character* must be entered to finalise the next selected current client. If the
   client number entered matches an existing client, the shared tail of the old current client's
   queue will be updated and it will be signalled before the current client is changed. Entering an
   invalid client number will return the virtualiser to the normal state without any change to the
   current client.

The two special characters *switch_char* and *terminate_num_char* are configurable using the
[Microkit sdfgen tool](https://au-ts.github.io/microkit_sdf_gen/).

If the current client's receive data region is full at the time of a character being enqueued, the
new character will be dropped. This ensures that the receive virtualiser may continue making
progress regardless of the state of a client's queue.

## Using the Serial Subsystem in your System

If you wish to use a platform that is not yet supported, you will need to create your own UART
driver to interface with the serial receive and transmit virtualisers. See
[here](/docs/developing.md) for tips on how to do this and [drivers.md](/docs/drivers.md) for
an existing list of all serial devices supported.

### SDF Generator Tool

It is highly recommended to use the [Microkit sdfgen
tool](https://au-ts.github.io/microkit_sdf_gen/) to create sDDF and LionsOS systems. To add a
*serial system* within a Python meta program, it is as simple as creating the UART driver and serial
virtualiser protection domains and passing them into the serial subsystem:
```py
from sdfgen import SystemDescription, Sddf

ProtectionDomain = SystemDescription.ProtectionDomain

serial_driver = ProtectionDomain("serial_driver", "serial_driver.elf", priority=200)
serial_virt_tx = ProtectionDomain("serial_virt_tx", "serial_virt_tx.elf", priority=198)
serial_virt_rx = ProtectionDomain("serial_virt_rx", "serial_virt_rx.elf", priority=199)

# Providing a virt rx is optional
serial_system = Sddf.Serial(sdf, serial_node, serial_driver, serial_virt_tx, virt_rx=serial_virt_rx)
```

Where the serial node is obtained from the board's device tree, and sdf is the system description
instance. Note that priorities of serial components and clients are all *configurable*, however the
system is designed with the assumption that the driver runs at the highest priority, followed by the
virtualisers and finally the clients. For further documentation on the options which can be provided
when creating a serial subsystem, or using the Microkit sdfgen tool in general, you can check the
documentation [here](https://au-ts.github.io/microkit_sdf_gen/).

Adding a protection domain as a client of the system is as simple as:
```py
client = ProtectionDomain("client", "client.elf", priority=1)
serial_system.add_client(client)
```

Additionally, clients of the serial subsystem will require the relevant serial data structures
described in the [Interfacing with Clients](#interfacing-with-clients) section below.

Currently the serial subsystem supports either *transmit only* mode, or *receive and transmit* where
all clients are configured to be able to receive characters. If the serial subsystem is created
*without* a receive virtualiser, then it will be transmit only. If a receive virtualiser is
provided, then each client will be given the ability to receive characters. In the future, receive
and transmit ability will be decided on a per client basis as each client is added to the system.

### Interfacing with Clients

The Microkit sdfgen tool will create all the serial resources required for each serial component.
The virtual addresses of memory regions and channel values will be placed into serialised C structs
and written to `.data` files in the build directory for each serial component. These structs are
called *config* structures, and the *serial* config structures are defined
[here](/include/sddf/serial/config.h). Once the meta program has completed, the makefile will use a
series of `OBJCOPY`s to update the corresponding sections in each elf file. This gives components
access to these values at boot time.

The `OBJCOPY` commands are in the makefile snippets, and look as follows:
```sh
$(OBJCOPY) --update-section .serial_client_config=serial_client_client0.data client0.elf
```
When a new serial client is added to the system, an additional `OBJCOPY` command must be added to
the makefile snippet to ensure the client's elf is updated accordingly.

Each serial client must declare a `serial_client_config_t` struct to be updated with values obtained
from the meta program. Clients must also declare serial queues which will be initialised with values
from the config struct. Typically, a client's serial declarations will look as follows:
```c
#include <sddf/serial/queue.h>
#include <sddf/serial/config.h>

__attribute__((__section__(".serial_client_config"))) serial_client_config_t serial_config;

serial_queue_handle_t rx_queue_handle;
serial_queue_handle_t tx_queue_handle;
```

These queues will need to initialised in the `init` function as follows:
```c
serial_queue_init(&rx_queue_handle, serial_config.rx.queue.vaddr, serial_config.rx.data.size, serial_config.rx.data.vaddr);
serial_queue_init(&tx_queue_handle, serial_config.tx.queue.vaddr, serial_config.tx.data.size, serial_config.tx.data.vaddr);
```

Additionally, if a client wishes to use `sddf_[d]printf`, this library will also need to be included
and initialised after the queues have been initialised:
```c
#include <sddf/util/printf.h>

serial_putchar_init(serial_config.tx.id, &tx_queue_handle);
```

As described in the [Transmission](#transmission) section, clients can either output using
`sddf_[d]printf`, or by writing characters to the queues directly using `serial_enqueue[_local]`
followed by `microkit_signal` to the serial transmit virtualiser channel (`serial_config.tx.id`).

When a client receives characters, it will be signalled by the receive virtualiser on channel
`serial_config.rx.id`. Receiving characters is typically done in a loop using `serial_dequeue`:
```c
char c;
while (!serial_dequeue(&rx_queue_handle, &c)) {
   ...
}
```

Note that if a client's data region is full at the time when the receive virtualiser tries to enqueue a
character, the character will be dropped.

### Building Components and Libraries

Our build system relies on makefile snippets to build sDDF components and libraries. The serial
components that are required to use the subsystem are:
* The corresponding UART driver for your platform. The C code and makefile snippet for the driver
  can be found in the platform directory [here](/drivers/serial/).
* The serial virtualisers. The receive virtualiser is optional depending on whether your system
  requires receive access. The C code and makefile snippet can be found
  [here](/serial/components/serial_components.mk).

You will need to include these snippets in your makefile to build the UART driver and serial
virtualisers.

Both the UART driver and serial virtualisers rely on the sDDF debug utility library
(`libsddf_util_debug.a`, which uses `microkit_dbg_puts`) for debug prints and assertions. The serial
version of `sddf_[d]printf` is also defined in the non-debug version of this library
(`libsddf_util.a`). The [snippet](/util/util.mk) which builds both these libraries will need to be
included in your makefile.

Serial components assume that `libsddf_util_debug.a` is present in `${LIBS}`. If a client wishes to
print via the serial subsystem, `libsddf_util.a` must be listed prior to `libsddf_util_debug.a`.

#### Include Paths

Serial components and clients will need to have the top level [sDDF include](/include/) in their
`CFLAGS` to access sDDF library functions as well as serial configuration structs.

## Running and Using

An example system utilising both the transmit and receive functionality of the serial subsystem can
be found [here](/examples/serial/). The [README](/examples/serial/README.md) describes how to build
and run the system as well as expected output.
