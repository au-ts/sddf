# Network echo server

This example shows off the networking sub-system by having a
[lwIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) based client talking to an ethernet device.

The client simply accepts RX traffic and sends it back out (hence the name 'echo server').

## Dependencies

Due to the echo server relying on libc functionality, it currently only works with GCC
instead of LLVM like all the other examples. As we use this example to perform benchmarking,
it is important that the functions that lwIP uses from the standard library are optimised
rather than simple implementations.

For now, we rely on the newlibc packaged with the embedded C toolchains.

The specific toolchain we use for testing and benchmarking the network sub-system is
the `aarch64-none-elf` GCC toolchain distributed by ARM. You can download it from
[here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).

## Building

The following platforms are supported:
* imx8mm_evk
* imx8mp_evk
* imx8mq_evk
* maaxboard
* odroidc4
* odroidc2
* qemu_virt_aarch64

```sh
make MICROKIT_BOARD=<board> MICROKIT_SDK=<path/to/sdk> MICROKIT_CONFIG=(benchmark/release/debug)
```

## Benchmarking

In order to run the benchmarks, set `MICROKIT_CONFIG=benchmark`. Currently only Aarch64 boards have
support for collecting of benchmarking data. The system has
been designed to interact with [ipbench](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipbench/)
to take measurements.

Checks to make before benchmarking:
* Turn off all debug prints.
* Run with LWIP asserts turned off as well (`LWIP_NOASSERT`).
* Make sure compiler optimisations are enabled.
