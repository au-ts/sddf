1. DEV receives 2 packets, sends an IRQ_RX
2. ETH processes 2 packets, sends ETH_RX_used notification to MUX_RX
3. MUX_RX receives ETH_RX_used notification, transfers 2 packets to CLT_RX_used, sends CLT_RX_used notification to CLT
4. CLT receives CLT_RX_used notification, transfers 2 packets to CLT_TX_used from CLT_TX_free and transfers 2 packets to CLT_RX_free from CLT_RX_used
-> Sends CLT_RX_free notification to MUX_RX
    5. MUX_RX receives CLT_RX_free notification, transfers 2 packets to ETH_RX_free and sends notification to ETH
    6. ETH receives ETH_RX_free notification, transfers 2 packets to hardware ring
    7. DEV receives 2 packets, sends IRQ_RX
    8. ETH receives IRQ_RX, transfers 2 packets to ETH_RX_used and sends notification to MUX_RX
    9. MUX_RX receives ETH_RX_used notification, transfers 2 packets to CLT_RX_used and sends notification to client
-> Sends CLT_TX_used notification to MUX_TX
10. MUX_TX receives CLT_TX_used notification, transfers 2 packets to ETH_TX_used and sends notification
11. ETH receives ETH_TX_used notification, transfers 2 packets to hardware ring
12. DEV sends 2 packets, sends IRQ_TX
13. ETH receives IRQ_TX, transfers 2 packets to ETH_TX_free, sends notification
14. MUX_TX receives ETH_TX_free notification, transfers 2 packets to CLT_TX_free and sends notification. Also sends notification to ETH_TX_used (unnecessarily causing ETH to wake up and go back to sleep)
15. CLT receives CLT_TX_free notification. Linked list size is zero so CLT_TX_free notify flag is set to 0. 
    CLT transfers 2 packets to CLT_TX_used from CLT_TX_free and transfers 2 packets to CLT_RX_free from CLT_RX_used
-> Sends CLT_RX_free notification to MUX_RX
